# Install Guide

If you just want to play Polished Crystal, use one of the .ips patches as described in [README.md](README.md#download-and-play). To build a ROM yourself from the source code, follow these instructions.

## Windows

To build on Windows, install [**Cygwin**](http://cygwin.com/install.html) with the default settings.

In the installer, select the following packages: `make`, `python`, `gcc-core`, `git`, and `gettext`.
If `gettext` no longer exists, get `libsasl2-3` and `ca-certificates`.

Then download [**rgbds 0.3.1**](https://github.com/bentley/rgbds/releases/). Other versions are not compatible. Extract the archive and put all the .exe and .dll files in C:\Cygwin\usr\local\bin.

In the **Cygwin terminal**:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/roukaour/polishedcrystal.git
cd polishedcrystal
```

To build **polishedcrystal.gbc**:

```bash
make
```

To build other versions:

```bash
make [faithful] [nortc] [monochrome] [debug]
```

For example, to build a mononchrome faithful version:

```bash
make faithful monochrome
```
